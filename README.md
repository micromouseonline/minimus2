# MINIMUS-2
A half size micromouse design.

## Intent

Create hardware and software for a half-size micromouse robot. The design should be simple and easy to reproduce. It is not necessarily meant to compete at the highest levels. Rather, it should provide a working platform for beginners while still forming the basis for more performant derivatives.
